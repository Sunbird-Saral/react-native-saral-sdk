# OMR detection
This folder contains an .ipynb notebook to understand the logic of how marked or un-marked circles in the OMR sheets are detected and the thresholding logic behind it 
# Run the .ipynb notebook
- Execute each cell to understand the logic behind thresholding

# Experiment with real-time filled and unfilled OMR sheets
- [Filled OMR sheets](https://github.com/Sunbird-Saral/Project-Saral/tree/main/models/v1.5/images/omr_filled)
- [Unfilled OMR sheets](https://github.com/Sunbird-Saral/Project-Saral/tree/main/models/v1.5/images/omr_unfilled)
